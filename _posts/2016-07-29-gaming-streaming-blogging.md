Gaming. Streaming. Blogging.

My entire life I have enjoyed playing video games.  I recently found myself caught up in the world of streaming and I must say that I am fascinated by it.  I decided to start streaming and created this website to chronicle the adventure.

## The games that I play

I plan to mainly stream Destiny. I am brand new to the game and currently exploring the vast amount of content it has to offer. I also have an affinity for Halo and FPS games such as Battlefield and Rainbow Six... probably because I am in the Military.

## Streaming on Twitch

I take pride in the quality of my stream. Since I am just starting out please bear with me as I work out the kinks and strive to output something of quality. Just click on the icon to find me on twitch.

## Blogging?Â¿

Occasionally I will write about something. You'll find it in the blog.

The **Stream **Team

Meet our awesome team. Actually, right now it's just me, however, I do have some awesome friends and I will soon start linking some of their content here.
